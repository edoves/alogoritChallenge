### Code Wars Remove First and Last Character

---

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

**For example:**

removeChar('eloquent') return 'loquen'
removeChar('country') return 'ountr'
removeChar('person') return 'erso'
removeChar('place') return 'lac'
